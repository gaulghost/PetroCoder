# PetroCoder
Task is to optimise ROP (Rate of Penetration) for Oil and Drilling. Since the cost of daily penetration is about $40,000 to $300,000. <br>
I participated in Petrocoder Hackathon in which we were provided the following task to optimise the following code. <br>
Code provided to modify was given by <a href="https://github.com/AndrzejTunkiel/USROP">Andrzej Tunkiel</a><br>
Refer <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410520311244">Dataset for rate of penetration benchmarking</a> under Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering by Elsevier to know the Problem faced while calculating ROP and why it still hasn't been perfected.
