Task is to optimise ROP (Rate of Penetration) for Oil and Drilling. Since the cost of daily penetration is about $40,000 to $300,000. <br>
I participated in Petrocoder Hackathon in which we were provided the following task to optimise the following code. <br>
For Reference refer the problem <a href="https://github.com/AndrzejTunkiel/USROP">Andrzej Tunkiel</a><br>

Task to achieve the highest MAE on an open and closed dataset. Data for 7 oil wells were provided. I achieved an accuracy of 99.76% using MSE criteria and 0.0736 MAE using MAE criteria. MAE recieved on on open dataset on a random well was 7.85
